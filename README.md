# Cpp-STL

## About-
- The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library.
</br>

- STL has four components
  - Algorithms
  - Containers
  - Functions
  - Iterators
</br>

- Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.
</br>

- This repository contains the implementation of the STL methods that will help you kickstart your competitive journey.
