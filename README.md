# Cpp-STL

## About-
- The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library.
</br>

- STL has four components
  - Algorithms
  - Containers
  - Functions
  - Iterators
</br>

- Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.
</br>

- This repository contains the implementation of the STL methods that will help you kickstart your competitive journey.

# Environment setup-

- Drop a :star: on the GitHub repository.
</br>

- Download any C++ IDE of choice.
  - Recommended-
    - [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/luna/r/eclipse-ide-cc-developers)
    - [Download Code Blocks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/)
</br>

- You can also use C++ with your favourite text editors. To compile C++ with any text editor, follow the steps.
  - Recommended-
    - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - [Download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
</br>

- Download and Install a C++ compiler of choice to use with your text editor.
  - Recommended-
    - [Download MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
</br>

- Now Setup your Environment variable for the Compiler.

    Steps-
    * Open your Control Panel
    ```
    My PC -> Properties
    ```

    * Follow the path
    ```
    Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> Click on Path -> Click New
    ```

    * Now add the path of the bin of your MinGW folder from where you installed the compiler.
    In most of the cases, it is going to be-
    ```
    C:\MinGW\bin
    ```
</br>

- For VS Code, Install extensions- (Recommended)
  - C/C++ by Microsoft
  - Code Runner by Jun Han
</br>

- For Sublime Text, setup the build file by cop pasting the content from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/luvk1412/Competitive-Programming) to your build file(json) depending upon your OS.
</br>

- Clone the repository by running this command in your git bash/ terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/Pranav016/Cpp-STL.git
```
</br>

- Now open the repo in your Code editor/ IDE and you are all set to use it.
